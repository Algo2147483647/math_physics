# Problems of Graph

## Determine connectivity

In the connectivity problem of the graph, each connected component can be regarded as a set. When there is an edge between two nodes, the sets of the two nodes are merged. If the two nodes eventually belong to the same set, they are connected; otherwise, they are not connected. Specifically, it can be achieved by union-find.

Union-Find Sets is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets, each containing a number of elements. It provides two operations: Union and Find.

- Union operation: takes two elements from different sets and merges them into a single set.
- Find operation: is used to determine which set an element belongs to. It takes an element as input and returns a representative element of the set containing that element.

## Traversal

### Depth-First Search

DFS is a graph traversal that dives as deep as possible into a graph before backtracking. Depth first search is implemented based on stack or recursion.

recursion:

```python
def dfs(graph, node, result):
    if node not in result:
        result.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, result)
    return result
```

stack :

```python
def dfs(graph, start):
    stack.push(start)
  
    while not stack.empty():
        node = stack.pop()
        result.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            stack.push(neighbor)
    return result
```

### Breadth-First Search

BFS is a graph traversal that explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Algorithm: Breadth-first search is implemented based on queues.

```python
def bfs(graph, start):
    queue.push(start)
  
    while not queue.empty():
        node = queue.pop()
        result.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            queue.push(neighbor)
    return result
```

### Travelling Salesman Problem

 Find the shortest closed path traversing all given points.

## Shortest Paths

For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with edge weight $w : E \to \mathbb R$, we aim to find the minimum sum of edge weights of path $P(v_s, v_e)$ from $v_s \to v_e$, 
$$
P(v_s, v_e) = \left(e_{1}^{(P)}, ..., e_{m}^{(P)} \ |\ e_{i}^{(P)} \in E, e_{1}^{(P)}[1] = v_{s}, e_{m}^{(P)}[2] = v_{e} \right) \tag{Path}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
d(v_s, v_e) = \min_{P} \quad& \sum_{e_{i}^{(P)} \in P} w(e_{i}^{(P)}) \\
s.t. \quad& e_{1}^{(P)}[1] = v_{s}\\
  & e_{m}^{(P)}[2] = v_{e}
\end{align*}
$$

### Property

- The shortest path has no loop
  $$
  e_{i}^{(P)} \neq e_{j}^{(P)} \quad, \text{if } i \neq j
  $$

- If $v_i$ and $v_j$ are relay nodes of shortest path $P_{\min}(v_1, v_k)$ between the node $v_1$ and $v_k$, then the subpath $P_{\min}(v_i, v_j) = (v_i, ..., v_j) \subset P(v_1, v_k)$ is the shortest path between the node $v_i$ and $v_j$. 
  $$
  P(v_i, v_j) \subset P_{\min}(v_1, v_k)  \Rightarrow  P_{\min}(v_i, v_j) = P(v_i, v_j)
  $$

- $\forall (v_i, v_j) \in E$
  $$
  d(v_s, v_j) \le d(v_s, v_i) + w((v_i, v_j))
  $$
  because $s \to i \to j$ is also a feasible path, then $d(P_{min}) \le d(P_{s \to i \to j})$.

- estimation of the shorteset paths and distances
  - Initial estimation
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \tilde d(v_s, v_s) &\gets 0  \tag{estimation of the shorteset distance}\\
    \tilde d(v_s, v_i) &\gets \inf, \quad v_i \in V - \{v_s\}\\
    \tilde P(v_s, v_i) &\gets (v_s), \quad v_i \in V  \tag{estimation of the shorteset path}\\
    \end{align*}
    $$

    where, $\tilde d(v_s, v_i)$ is the estimation and upper-bound of $d(v_s, v_i)$, while $\tilde P(v_s, v_i) \Leftrightarrow \tilde d(v_s, v_i) = \inf$.

  - Update estimation
    if there is an edge $(v_i, v_j)$, make the path better $\tilde d(v_s, v_j) > \tilde d(v_s, v_i) + w((v_i, v_j))$, then,
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \tilde d(v_s, v_j) &\gets \tilde d(v_s, v_i) + w((v_i, v_j))  \\
    \tilde P(v_s, v_j) &\gets \tilde P(v_s, v_i) + (v_j)
    \end{align*}
    $$

    for a subgraph $G' = G - (\{v_i\}, \{(v_i, \cdot), (\cdot, v_i)\})$, we have

    $$
    \begin{align*}
      d^{(G)}(v_s, v_i) &= \min_{v_j \in V^{(G')}} \left(d^{(G')}(v_s, v_j) + w((v_j, v_i))\right)  \\
      d^{(G)}(v_s, v_j) &\le d^{(G)}(v_s, v_i) + w(v_i, v_j) \quad, \forall (v_i, v_j) \in E^{(G)}  \\
      P_{\min}^{(G)}(v_s, v_i) &= \arg\min_{P_{\min}^{(G')}(v_s, v_j)} \left(d\left(P_{\min}^{(G')}(v_s, v_j)\right)+ w((v_j, v_i))\right) + (v_i)
    \end{align*}
    $$

### All-Pairs Shortest Paths

#### Floyd's Algorithm

Base on danemic programming, there is a Tensor $M^{(d)}, M^{(p)} \in \mathbb R^{n \times n \times (n+1)}$, where $M_{i, j, k}$ refer to the minimum distance and path from $v_i \to v_j$ with optional intermediate vertices $\{v_1, ..., v_k\}$. When $k = 0$, $M_{i, j, 0}$ refer to the distance of direct path $(v_i, v_j)$ with no intermediate vertice. When $k = n$, $M_{i, j, n}$ is the answer of the shorest distance and path of all virtice pairs.
$$
\begin{align*} 
  G &= M^{(d)}_{\cdot, \cdot, 0}  \\
  D &= M^{(d)}_{\cdot, \cdot, n}
\end{align*}
$$

For $k$ and optional intermediate vertices $\{v_1, ..., v_k\}$, $M^{(d)}_{\cdot, \cdot, k}$ could be obtained by $M^{(d)}_{\cdot, \cdot, k-1}$ through determines whether to select $v_k$ as the intermediate node.
$$
  M^{(d)}_{i, j, k} = \min \left(M^{(d)}_{i, j, k-1},\ M^{(d)}_{i, k, k-1} + M^{(d)}_{k, j, k-1}\right)
$$

```c
dis = G;

for (int k = 1; k <= N; k++)
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++)
      dis(i, j) = dis(i, j) > dis(i, k) + dis(k, j) ?
                  path(i, j) = k, dis(i, k) + dis(k, j) :
                  dis(i, j);
```

### Single-Source Shortest Paths

#### Dijkstra Algorithm

- Initially, we mark all nodes as unvisited and set the distance from source node to the itself to zero, and the distance to all other nodes to infinity.
- Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance from source node (the first selected node is source node itself), mark it as visited, and update the distance of all nodes through the new node accordingly.
- Repeat above step until the destination node is visited or there are no more unvisited nodes.

```python
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    shortest_path = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    shortest_path[start] = 0
  
    priority_queue.push((0, start))
  
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_vertex = priority_queue.pop()
      
        if current_distance > shortest_path[current_vertex]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            if distance < shortest_path[neighbor]:
                shortest_path[neighbor] = distance
                priority_queue.push((distance, neighbor))

    return shortest_path
```

#### Bellman Ford Algorithm

当图中存在负权边或需要检测负权环时，Bellman-Ford是合适的选择，否则Dijkstra或A*可能更高效。

#### A* Algorithm

A* Algorithm 是已知目标的启发式搜索. 结合了Dijkstra算法的最优性保证（确保找到最短路径）和贪心最佳优先搜索的高效性, 通过启发式函数引导搜索方向. The A* algorithm determines the search direction by evaluating the **comprehensive cost** of each node
$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
$$

- $g(n)$: The actual cost from the starting point to the current node $n$ (known).
- $h(n)$: The estimated cost from the current node $n$ to the target point (heuristic function, which must meet the acceptability).
- $f(n)$: The comprehensive priority of the node, giving priority to expanding the node with the smallest $f(n)$.

## Minimum Spanning Tree

Find a Tree (acyclic subgraph) on the undirected Graph $T \subseteq G, V^{(T)} = V^{(G)}$ with the smallest sum of edge weights connected all nodes.

$$
\begin{align*}
  T_{\min} =  \arg\min_{T \subseteq G} \quad & \sum_{e \in E^{(T)}} w(e)  \\
  s.t. \quad & V^{(T)} = V^{(G)} \\
  & T \text{ is acyclic}
\end{align*}
$$

### Property

$$
\begin{align*}
  T_{\min}^{(G)} &\Rightarrow \left(T_{\min}^{(G)} - \{v_i\}\right) \text{ is a min spanning tree of } (G - \{v_i\})  \\
  T_{\min}^{(G - \{v_i\})} &\Rightarrow \left(T_{\min}^{(G - \{v_i\})} + \arg\min_{e \in (v_i,\cdot)} w(e) \right)  \text{ is a min spanning tree of } G
\end{align*}
$$

### Solution

#### Prim's Algorithm

Greed by vertices, put the shortest edge $(u,v)$ of $u$ from the searched vertices into the result edge sequence every time, and $v$ does not belong to the searched vertices. $T_{\min, k}$ refers to a sub-tree of $T_{\min}$ with $k+1$ vertices and $k$ edges.
$$
\begin{align*} 
  T_{\min, 0} &= (\{v_1\}, \emptyset)  \tag{initial}\\
  T_{\min, n} &= T_{\min}  \tag{answer}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
  (v_k, e_k) = \arg\min_{e_k = (v_k, v')}\quad & w(e_k)  \\
  s.t. \quad
  & e_k \in E^{(G)}  \\
  & v_k \in V^{(G)}  \\
  & v_k \notin V^{(T_{\min, k-1})}  \\
  & v' \in V^{(T_{\min, k-1})}
\end{align*}
$$
$$T_{\min, k} = T_{\min, k-1} + (\{v_k\}, \{e_k\})$$

- Property: Time complexity $O(E \cdot logV)$

```python
def prim(graph):
    start_vertex = list(graph.keys())[0]
    result = set()
    visited = set([start_vertex])
    edges = priority_queue()
    edges.push(
        (cost, start_vertex, to)
        for to, cost in graph[start_vertex].items()
    )

    while not edges.empty():
        cost, frm, to = edges.pop()
        if to not in visited:
            visited.add(to)
            result.add((frm, to))
            for to_next, cost2 in graph[to].items():
                if to_next not in visited:
                    edges.push((cost2, to, to_next))

    return result
```



#### Kruskal's Algorithm
Greed by edges. $T_{\min, k}$ refers to a sub-tree of $T_{\min}$ with $k$ edges.
$$
\begin{align*} 
  T_{\min, 0} &= (V^{(G)}, \emptyset)  \tag{initial}\\
  T_{\min, n} &= T_{\min}  \tag{answer}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
  e_k =& \arg\min_{e_k \in E^{(G)}}\quad w(e_k)  \\
  &s.t. \quad \nexists \text{ path } \in T_{\min, k-1} \text{ , lets } e_k[1] \to e_k[2]
\end{align*}
$$

$$
T_{\min, k} = T_{\min, k-1} + (\{e_k\})
$$

- Property: Time complexity $O(E \cdot logV)$

Depth first search is implemented based on union-find set.

```python
def kruskal(graph):
    result = []
    edges = []
    parent = {}

    for vertex in graph:
        parent[vertex] = vertex
        for neighbor, weight in graph[vertex].items():
            edges.append((weight, vertex, neighbor))

    edges.sort()

    for edge in edges:
        weight, vertex1, vertex2 = edge
        root1 = find(parent, vertex1)
        root2 = find(parent, vertex2)

        if root1 != root2:
            result.append(edge)
            union(parent, root1, root2)

    return result
```

## Network Flow Problem

We set $G'$ is a sub-graph of $G$, Equal inflow and outflow of non source and sink
$$
\begin{align*}
  w'(u, v) &\le w(u, v)  \tag{Flow constraint}\\
  \sum_i w'(u, v_i) &= \sum_i w'(v_i, u)  \quad; u \neq s, u \neq e
\end{align*}
$$

### Maximum Flow Problem

Maximum flow rate at source and sink
$$
\begin{align*}
  \max \quad & \sum_i w'(v_i, e) = w'(s, v_i) \\
  s.t. \quad & w'(u, v) \le w(u, v) \\
    &\sum_i w'(u, v_i) = \sum_i w'(v_i, u)  \quad ; u \neq s, u \neq e
\end{align*}
$$
#### Solution: Dinic Algorithm

### Minimum Cost Problem



## Graph Coloring Problem

### Vertex coloring

a coloring of a graph almost always refers to a proper vertex coloring, namely a labeling of the graph's vertices with colors such that no two vertices sharing the same edge have the same color. Since a vertex with a loop (i.e. a connection directly back to itself) could never be properly colored, it is understood that graphs in this context are loopless.

### Edge coloring

an assignment of colors to edges so that no vertex is incident to two edges of the same color. An edge coloring with k colors is called a k-edge-coloring and is equivalent to the problem of partitioning the edge set into k matchings. The smallest number of colors needed for an edge coloring of a graph G is the chromatic index, or edge chromatic number, χ′(G). 

## Search Euler Path

### Solution: Hierholzer's algorithm 

```python
def find_eulerian_path_or_cycle(graph):
    current_vertex = next(iter(graph))

    stack = [current_vertex]
    path = []

    while not stack.empty():
        if not graph[current_vertex].empty():
            stack.append(current_vertex)
            next_vertex = graph[current_vertex].pop()
         
            if graph[current_vertex].empty():
                del graph[current_vertex]
            current_vertex = next_vertex
        else:
            path.append(current_vertex)
            current_vertex = stack.pop()

    if not graph.empty():
        return None
    return path
```
