## Intersection of Ray-Surface in Spaces with Constant Curvature

### Hyperbolic Space (Negative Curvature)

### Spherical / Elliptic Space (Positive Curvature)

$$
\boldsymbol x(t) = \cos(\frac{t}{R}) \boldsymbol x_0   + R \sin(\frac{t}{R})  \boldsymbol {\hat d} \tag{ray}
$$

- $t$: The distance from the origin of the ray to the intersection of ray-surface.
- $R$: The radius of the hypersphere.

$$
|\boldsymbol x(t)| = R
$$
