# Symmetric Group

[TOC]

## Define

$$
  S_n = (\{f: X \to X\}, \circ)
$$

Symmetric group on a finite set $X$ is the group whose elements are all bijective functions $f: X \to X$ and whose group operation is that of function composition $f_1 \circ f_2 = f_1(f_2(\cdot))$. Where $n$ is the degree of symmetric group, that is, the number of elements in set $X$.

## Properties

- Cayley's theorem: every group $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group.

* Permutation Group
    - Define
      Permutation group is a group $G$ whose elements are permutations of a given set $M$ and whose group operation is the composition of permutations in $G$ (which are thought of as bijective functions from the set $M$ to itself).  

    - Property
      - every group is isomorphic to some permutation group.
