            "- The existence of an Euler path or circuit in a connected undirected graph depends on the degree of the vertices. For a graph to have an Euler circuit, every vertex must have an even degree. For a connected undirected graph to have an Euler path, exactly two vertices must have an odd degree (all other vertices must have even degree).\n\n\n### Matching of Graph\n\n#### Define\n\n$$\n\\forall e_i, e_j \\in M \\subseteq E, e_i \\neq e_j \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad v(e_i, 1) \\neq v(e_i, 2) \\neq v(e_j, 1) \\neq v(e_j, 2)  \\tag{Matching}\n$$\nMatching of a graph is a set of edges $M \\subseteq E$ that have no common points between any two edges.\n\n#### Include\n\n- Maximum Matching\n  $$\n  M^* = \\arg\\max_{M} \\quad \\text{number}(M) \\tag{Maximum Matching}\n  $$\n  Maximum Matching is a matching with the largest number of matching edges among all matches in a graph.\n  \n- Perfect Matching\n  $$\n  V^{(G)} = v(M^*)\n  $$\n  Perfect Matching is a matching that all vertices of the graph are in it."

The most commonly used axiomatic system for set theory is Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC axiomatic system):\n\n1. **Axiom of Extensionality**: Two sets are equal if they have the same elements.\n   $$\n   \\forall A \\forall B (\\forall x (x \\in A \\leftrightarrow x \\in B) \\rightarrow A = B)\n   $$\n\n2. **Axiom of Regularity (also known as the Axiom of Foundation)**: Every non-empty set has a member that is disjoint from it. \n   $$\n   \\forall x(x \\neq \\varnothing \\rightarrow \\exists y(y \\in x \\wedge y \\cap x=\\varnothing))\n   $$\n\n3. **Axiom of Pairing**: For any two sets, there is a set that contains exactly those two sets.\n   $$\n   \\forall x \\forall y \\exists B \\forall z (z \\in B \\leftrightarrow (z = x \u2228 z = y))\n   $$\n\n4. **Axiom of Union**: For any set of sets, there is a set that contains all the elements of those sets.\n   $$\n   \\forall A \\exists B \\forall x (x \\in B \\leftrightarrow \\exists C (x \\in C \u2227 C \\in A))\n   $$\n\n5. **Axiom of Infinity**: There exists a set that contains the empty set and is closed under the operation of \"successor\" which is defined for any set $x$ as $x \\cup \\{x\\}$.\n   $$\n   \\exists A (\u2205 \\in A \u2227 \\forall x (x \\in A \\rightarrow x \u222a {x} \\in A))\n   $$\n\n6. **Axiom Schema of Separation (also known as the Axiom Schema of Comprehension)**: For any set and any property that can be defined without reference to the whole set, there is a subset containing exactly those elements of the original set that have the property.\n   $$\n   \\forall w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{n}\\,\\forall A\\,\\exists B\\,\\forall x\\,(x\\in B\\Leftrightarrow [x\\in A\\land \\varphi (x,w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{n},A)])\n   $$\n\n7. **Axiom of Power Set**: For any set, there is a set of all its subsets.\n   $$\n   \\forall A \\exists B \\forall C (C \\in B \\leftrightarrow \\forall x (x \\in C \\rightarrow x \\in A))\n   $$\n\n8. **Axiom Schema of Replacement**: If a property defines a function on a set, then the image of the set under that function is also a set.\n   $$\n   \\forall A (\\forall x \\in A \\exists !y \u03c6(x, y, p1, ..., pn) \\rightarrow \\exists B \\forall x \\in A \\exists y (y \\in B \u2227 \u03c6(x, y, p1, ..., pn)))\n   $$\n\n9. **Axiom of Choice**: For any set of non-empty sets, there exists a choice function that selects one element from each set.\n   $$\n   \\forall A (\\exists B \\forall x (x \\in B \\leftrightarrow (\\exists y (y \\in A \u2227 \\forall z (z \\in A \\rightarrow (z = y \u2228 \u00acS(z, y)))))))\n   $$",
