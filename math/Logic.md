# Logic

## Define

> Logic studies formal languages, truth conditions, and inference rules for valid reasoning.

A logical system specifies:

- **Syntax**: which symbolic expressions are well-formed formulas.
- **Semantics**: when formulas are true under an interpretation.
- **Proof system**: which formal inference rules are allowed.

Two central relations are:
$$
\Gamma\models\varphi
\quad\text{and}\quad
\Gamma\vdash\varphi.
$$

Here $\Gamma$ is a set of formulas and $\varphi$ is a formula.

- $\Gamma\models\varphi$ means $\varphi$ is a semantic consequence of $\Gamma$.
- $\Gamma\vdash\varphi$ means $\varphi$ is formally derivable from $\Gamma$.

## Properties

### Syntax

Syntax describes the formal symbols and formation rules of a logical language.

#### Proposition

A proposition is a statement that has a truth value: true or false.

In formal logic, one usually works with formulas. A proposition may be understood as a formula with a determined truth value, or as a closed formula in a given interpretation.

#### Logical Connectives

Logical connectives combine formulas into larger formulas:

- Negation: $\neg\varphi$
- Conjunction: $\varphi\wedge\psi$
- Disjunction: $\varphi\vee\psi$
- Implication: $\varphi\rightarrow\psi$
- Equivalence: $\varphi\leftrightarrow\psi$

#### Truth Constants

The truth constants are:

- true: $\top$
- false: $\bot$

#### Variables, Constants, and Predicates

Variables represent arbitrary objects:
$$
x,y,z,\cdots
$$

Constants represent fixed objects:
$$
a,b,c,\cdots
$$

Predicates represent properties or relations:
$$
P(x),\quad R(x,y),\quad S(x_1,\cdots,x_n).
$$

#### Quantifiers

Quantifiers bind variables and express quantity over a domain of discourse:

- Universal quantifier: $\forall x\,\varphi(x)$
- Existential quantifier: $\exists x\,\varphi(x)$
- Unique existence quantifier: $\exists!x\,\varphi(x)$

### Semantics

Semantics assigns meaning and truth values to formulas.

#### Interpretation

An interpretation gives meanings to the non-logical symbols of a language. It specifies:

- a domain of discourse;
- the objects denoted by constants;
- the relations denoted by predicates;
- the functions denoted by function symbols, if the language has them.

#### Model

A model is an interpretation in which a formula or a set of formulas is true.

The notation
$$
\mathcal M\models\varphi
$$
means that the formula $\varphi$ is true in the model $\mathcal M$.

For a set of formulas $\Gamma$,
$$
\mathcal M\models\Gamma
$$
means that every formula in $\Gamma$ is true in $\mathcal M$.

#### Satisfiability

A set of formulas $\Gamma$ is satisfiable if there exists a model $\mathcal M$ such that
$$
\mathcal M\models\Gamma.
$$

#### Validity

A formula $\varphi$ is valid if it is true in every model:
$$
\models\varphi.
$$

### Logical Consequence

A formula $\varphi$ is a semantic consequence of $\Gamma$ if every model of $\Gamma$ is also a model of $\varphi$:
$$
\Gamma\models\varphi.
$$

That is,
$$
\forall\mathcal M,\quad
\mathcal M\models\Gamma
\Rightarrow
\mathcal M\models\varphi.
$$

### Formal Proof

Formal proof is syntactic. It depends only on symbols, axioms, and inference rules.

#### Axiom

An axiom is a formula accepted as a starting point of a formal system.

#### Inference Rule

An inference rule specifies when a formula may be derived from earlier formulas.

For example, modus ponens has the form:
$$
\frac{\varphi,\quad \varphi\rightarrow\psi}{\psi}.
$$

#### Theorem

A theorem is a formula derivable from the axioms using inference rules.

The notation
$$
\Gamma\vdash\varphi
$$
means that there is a finite formal proof of $\varphi$ from assumptions $\Gamma$.

### Soundness and Completeness

Soundness says that formal proof preserves semantic truth:
$$
\Gamma\vdash\varphi
\Rightarrow
\Gamma\models\varphi.
$$

Completeness says that every semantic consequence can be formally proved:
$$
\Gamma\models\varphi
\Rightarrow
\Gamma\vdash\varphi.
$$

These statements depend on the specific logical system and proof system being used.

### Consistency

A set of formulas $\Gamma$ is syntactically consistent if there is no formula $\varphi$ such that both $\varphi$ and its negation are derivable:
$$
\nexists\varphi
\quad
\left(
\Gamma\vdash\varphi
\ \text{and}\
\Gamma\vdash\neg\varphi
\right).
$$

For classical logic, inconsistency is explosive: from a contradiction, every formula becomes derivable.

### Propositional Logic

Propositional logic studies formulas built from atomic propositions using logical connectives.

The truth of a propositional formula is determined by a truth assignment to its atomic propositions.

### First-order Logic

First-order logic extends propositional logic by adding:

- variables;
- constants;
- predicates;
- function symbols;
- quantifiers over individual objects.

First-order logic can express statements about elements of a domain and relations between them.

### Axiomatic System

An axiomatic system consists of:

- a formal language;
- a set of axioms;
- a set of inference rules.

It provides a framework for deriving theorems from axioms by formal proof.

### Godel's Incompleteness Theorems

Godel's incompleteness theorems concern formal systems strong enough to express elementary arithmetic.

#### First Incompleteness Theorem

Any consistent, effectively axiomatized formal system strong enough to express elementary arithmetic is incomplete: there are arithmetic statements that can neither be proved nor disproved in the system.

#### Second Incompleteness Theorem

Such a system cannot prove its own consistency, assuming it is consistent.
