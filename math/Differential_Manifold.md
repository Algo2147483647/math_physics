## Define

Differential manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ is a manifold and equipped with a differentiable structure.

Differentiable Structure: There exists a collection of charts $\{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)\}$ such that the open sets $U_\alpha$ cover $M$ and the transition maps $\varphi_\beta\circ \varphi_\alpha^{-1}: \varphi_\alpha(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \to \varphi_\beta(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)$ are differentiable functions for all overlapping charts $(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)$ and $(U_\beta, \varphi_\beta)$. This collection of charts is called an atlas.
