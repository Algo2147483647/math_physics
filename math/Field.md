## Define

Field is a [ring](./Ring.md) that satisfies the existence of multiplicative inverses for every nonzero element.

## Properties

### Field extension

- Define

  A field extension is a pair of fields $E$ and $F$ such that the operations of $F$ are those of $E$ restricted to $F$. In other words, $F$ is a subset of $E$, and the addition and multiplication of elements of $F$ in $E$ coincide with their addition and multiplication in $F$. When $F$ is a subfield of $E$, we often say that $E$ is an extension of $F$ and write $E/F$.
