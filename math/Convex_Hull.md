# Convex Hull

[TOC]

## Define

A set of points in a Euclidean space is defined to be convex if it contains the line segments connecting each pair of its points. The convex hull of a given set $S$ may be defined as

- The (unique) minimal convex set containing $S$
- The intersection of all convex sets containing $S$
- The set of all convex combinations of points in $S$
- The union of all simplices with vertices in $S$
